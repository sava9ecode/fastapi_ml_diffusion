# Stable Diffusion with ðŸ§¨ Diffusers

This is a simple ML web app developed with FastAPI to generate images from text.

[Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion) is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from CompVis, Stability AI and LAION. It is trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B database. LAION-5B is the largest, freely accessible multi-modal dataset that currently exists.
